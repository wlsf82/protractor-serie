# protractor-serie

⚠️ **This project has been deprecated.** ⚠️

A project for sharing knowledge about protractor usage.

Since I'm working with e2e testing for AngularJS and non-AngularJS, for web and mobile apps (with Protractor), I've created a video serie, called "Learning Protractor", and this will be the repository where I'll store the serie's code files.

You can follow the serie and other posts about protractor here (this is in PT-BR):  http://talkingabouttesting.com/category/protractor-2/
